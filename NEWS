flacco_1.1:
- barrier trees:
-- fixed a bug in feature computation: ratio of levels and nodes should only be taken for the maximum number of levels
-- added number of leaves as a feature
- replace createInitialDesign by createInitialSample as that name should be more intuitive and less misleading
- createInitialSample stores the attributes lower and upper, which will be used by createFeatureObject

flacco_1.0:
- Initial release to CRAN
